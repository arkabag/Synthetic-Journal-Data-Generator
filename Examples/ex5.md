**Dish:** Spaghetti Aglio e Olio

**Recipe:**

**Ingredients:**
- 8 oz (225g) of spaghetti
- 4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup (60ml) extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 cup (60ml) fresh Italian parsley, chopped
- Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
- Salt and black pepper to taste

**Instructions:**
1. Begin by boiling a large pot of salted water. Once boiling, add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.

2. While the spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add the thinly sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté them gently, being careful not to brown the garlic, for about 4-5 minutes until it's fragrant and lightly golden.

3. Once the spaghetti is cooked, use tongs to transfer it directly from the pot to the skillet with the garlic and olive oil. Toss to combine, ensuring the spaghetti is well-coated with the infused oil.

4. Add the chopped Italian parsley to the skillet and continue to toss the spaghetti, making sure the parsley is evenly distributed.

5. Season the dish with salt and black pepper to taste. The pasta should be well-seasoned to bring out the flavors.

6. Serve immediately, garnishing with grated Parmesan cheese and additional red pepper flakes if you like it spicy.
